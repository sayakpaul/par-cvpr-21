Contains code for launching a few different adversarial attacks including simple and targeted Project Gradient Descent based (PGD) attacks. We also study the effect of PGD on EfficientNet and its different variants like [AdvProp](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09665) and [Noisy Student Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04252). For a bit more real-world-ish coverage, we also study these effects on custom image classification models trained using different pre-trained weights along with different optimizers.
