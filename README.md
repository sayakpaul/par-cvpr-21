## Outline 

A detailed outline is available [on the website](https://sites.google.com/view/par-2021#outline). 

We provide Jupyter Notebooks to demonstrate some of the topics mentioned in the outline. These notebooks are fully runnable on [Google Colab]((https://colab.research.google.com/) without any non-trivial configurations.

## How to run the notebooks?

Here are the steps - 

* First, get the [Open in Colab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo?hl=en) Google Chrome extension. 
* Follow [this screencast](https://www.loom.com/share/602f3d0823ae40e3b6d5a8187d421a37) that shows how to navigate to a particular notebook inside this repository and open it in Google Colab. 

## Major libraries used

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Keras](https://keras.io)
* [Neural Structured Learning](https://www.tensorflow.org/neural_structured_learning)
